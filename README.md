# floodlight-appfirewall
This is a package of Floodlight SDN controller that works as application layer firewall

AppFirewall package consist of new Floodlight module which is intended to implement application layer firewall feature on the OpenFlow networks. This module is created with Floodlight version 12 and tested working with OpenFlow version 10. In order to make this module fully functional, package of forwarding.Forwarding must be disabled.

This module has REST API implemented. To test the REST API, simply execute Python script name AppFirewall.py inside 'python script' folder. Except for /list feature are meant to be tested directly from Internet browser.

This project is part of my bachelor thesis, yet developed under open source technology. Thereby, everyone is free to use and develop this further.
